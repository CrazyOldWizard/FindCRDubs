# FindCrunchyrollDubs
A command line tool that crawls Crunchyroll.com and checks every show to see if the show has an english dub version.

To use, simply download the zip from the release section and then extract and run the exe.  
When finished, a text file in the same folder will have a list of all the shows it found.
